## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript
- A web browser
- An internet connection

## Setting Up Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase URL**: Navigate to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) in your web browser.
2. **Create an Account**: Click on the "Start your project" button. If you don't have an account, sign up using your email address or through GitHub.
3. **Log In**: After creating your account, log in to your Supabase dashboard.

## Creating the Project

1. **Create a New Project**:
   - Click on the "New Project" button.
   - Enter a name for your project in the "Project Name" field.
   - Select a region closest to you for better performance.
   - Click on "Create new project."

2. **Obtain API Key and URL**:
   - Once the project is created, go to the "Settings" tab in your project.
   - Under "API," you'll find your `supabaseUrl` and `supabaseKey` (anon key). Note these down for use in your project.

## Configuring the Database

1. **Creating the Users Table**:
   - Navigate to the "Table Editor" in the Supabase dashboard.
   - Click on "Create a new table."
   - Name your table `users`.

2. **Adding Columns to the Users Table**:
   - Add the following columns to the `users` table:
     - `id`: Type - **Integer** (selected `8 int` instead of `bigint` as it was not available)
     - `email`: Type - **Text**
     - `password`: Type - **Text**
   - Ensure the `id` column is set as the primary key.

3. **Save the Table**: Once you've added the columns, save the changes.

## Disabling Row-Level Security

1. **Disable Row-Level Security**:
   - Go to the "Authentication" section of your project.
   - Find the option for "Row Level Security" and disable it. This step is crucial for allowing unrestricted access for the operations in this example.

## Running the Project

1. **Open the Project File**: 
   - Locate the `login.html` file in your project directory. You can use any code editor you prefer, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++. Right-click on the `login.html` file and select "Open with" to choose your code editor.

2. **Configure Supabase Credentials**: 
   - In the code editor, scroll down to find the section where the Supabase client is initialized. You should see something like this:
     ```javascript
     const supabaseUrl = '[your project url]';
     const supabaseKey = '[your big anon api key]';
     ```
   - Replace `[your project url]` with the URL of your Supabase project that you noted down earlier. This will typically look something like `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co`.
   - Replace `[your big anon api key]` with the Anon public API key from your Supabase project settings. This key allows your front-end application to communicate with your Supabase backend.

3. **Save Your Changes**: 
   - After updating the credentials, make sure to save the changes in your code editor. This is usually done by pressing `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Command + S` (Mac).

4. **Run the HTML File**: 
   - Once you've saved the changes, you can run the HTML file. Simply navigate to the location of the `login.html` file in your file explorer, and double-click on it. This will open the file in your default web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can right-click the `login.html` file and choose "Open with" followed by your preferred web browser.

5. **Test the Application**: 
   - When the browser opens the file, you should see the registration and login forms. You can now register a new user by filling out the registration form and then log in with the credentials you created.

By following these steps, your application should be up and running, allowing you to register and log in using Supabase!
